This is my first public project, so I'm not quite sure what to put here....

How about this, the script will walk you through how to use it, and if your still unsure, dm me on discord! https://discord.gg/guW2yDFZ

Feel free to edit this script and make it better, but PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, give me credit :)

thats it!

Oh I should probably explain what this does, basically you know how sometimes your driving a car in ERLC, and you want to chat on the radio but you cant steer while your chatting? Well this fixes that! it uses Whisper (from OpenAI) to transcribe you speech to text! simply hold down a key of your choice, and it would automatically record your voice, actiavte the radio, type the message, and click enter!

happy roleplaying!
