Welcome to ERLC_thing! (this name will probably be changed later)

ERLC_thing is a simple and user-friendly way of enabling voicechat for the police/dot/FD radios!

How does it work you may ask? It's quite simple actually, I activate the ingame radio (as an indicator I am recording), them I simply record whatever the user says, then I use OpenAI's "Whisper" to transcribe what has been said to text, then finally, I type whatever whisper transcribed, and press ENTER!

This project is still in the very early stages of development, and testers are welcome! 
If you encounter any issues, please make a ticket here: discord.gg/9F59Dks4bp

Additionally, I spent an incredible ammount of time making the program user-friendly, and child proofing it, so it is virtually impossible to crash it with silly mistakes.
